# Automation-SeleniumWebDriver
###### My first automation projects ðŸ« 

These are my solutions to challenges given in the Udemy course '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023' (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). 

### - Day 48. Auto_CookieGame_main.py: Automatic Cookie Clicker.
Automatization of the Cookie game (classic version). You can play the game here: http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/.
In this script, I added some statistic collection for fun, and also because I want to use machine learning to find the best strategy, but that will be a project for later.

### - Day 49. Auto_LinkedIn_main.py: Automatic save-and-follow-bot on LinkedIn.
I chose alternative 2: Save all the job postings that meet your criteria, and follow the company that postet the job.
