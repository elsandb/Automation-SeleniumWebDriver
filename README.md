## Automatic "save and follow"-bot on LinkedIn.

###### My first automation project - don't expect magic.

This is my solution to the challenge given on day 49 of '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023' (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

I chose alternative 2: Instead of applying to all the jobs that meet your criteria, "Save" all the job postings that meet your criteria and follow the company that postet the job.
