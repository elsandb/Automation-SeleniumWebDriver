# Automation-SeleniumWebDriver
###### My first automation projects.

These are my solutions to challenges given in the Udemy course '100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023' (https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). 

### - Day 48. Automatic Cookie Clicker.
- Auto_CookieGame_main.py
- Auto_CookieGame_stats.csv

Automatization of the Cookie game (classic version). You can play the game here: http://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/.
I added code to collect some game statistics.

### - Day 49. Automatic save-and-follow-bot on LinkedIn.
-Auto_LinkedIn_main.py

I chose alternative 2: Save all the job postings that meet your criteria, and follow the company that postet the job.
